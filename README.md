Enigma - A minimalist, locked-down one-to-one chat app.

## Features

**Authentication:** Passcode authentication is enabled which is needed to unlock hidden and locked chats. If your device supports fingerprint authentication, then you can use it as well.

**Hide Chats:** You can hide chats to protect against prying eyes. YOU will have to authorize to unhide the chats.

**Lock Chats:** Hidden chats not secure enough? Lock individual chats which only open after YOU have authorized it.

**End Conversations:** Once you're done with a conversation, you can choose to end it, by swiping your friend's message from left to right. Doing so will delete all the conversation up until that message. 

**Save messages:** Double tap on any message to save it locally. Saved messages can be viewed by swiping right to left on the chat screen.

**No pesky notifications:** We do not believe in keeping users addicted to our app by frequent notifications. Chat when you feel like it. We do not bother you with notifications.

**No forwarding:** Enigma is developed to be an intimate one-to-one chat application. There's no option for forwarding messages. Hence no fake news.

**Beautiful, minimal UI:** The UI is uncluttered and beautiful. Gestures are used to make it pragmatic instead of using additional screen space.

**Less than 10 MB:** All the above features are tucked under a measely < 10 MB APK Size.
